  Hello, welcome to the experiment! <br>

  <br>
  In this game, you will encounter a life scenario, and please get involved as much as you can. <br>
  The next page would introduce you how to play this game. There is no time limit on the introduction page.
  <br>Please spend some time there and get yourself familiar with the game as much as you can, as there would be time limitations when you start the game. 
  <br><br>
  There would be a questionaire after you've completed the game. Please fill it in and submit it. <br>After that, you will get a code for 
  Prolific, which you can use in Prolific to get your compensation.  <br>
  All the data collected here would be for scientific use. 
  
 
   <br><br><br>

  If you agree to participate in this experiment, please enter your prolific ID and demographic information to start. 
  <br>The whole experiment will take around 15 minutes in total. <br><br>
  Thanks for your participation!
